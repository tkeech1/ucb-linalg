    "Vector spaces are a generalization of the properties of real vectors. Formally, a vector space is a set $V$ together with:\n",

    "* additive inverse $-: V \\rightarrow V $\n",
    "* zero vector $ 0 \\in V$\n",

    "That satsfies the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall x,y,z \\in V$ and $\\forall a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $+$ is associative: $x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z$\n",
    "2) $+$ is commutative: $x+y = y+x$\n",
    "3) $0$ is an additive identity: $x+0 = x = 0+x$\n",

    "   NOTE: $a \\cdot b$ is multiplication by real numbers (since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Multiplying by $x$ is scalar multiplication since $x \\in V$. On the right hand side, the $a \\cdot b$ is also scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
